Following is the software/package requirement to run the code:
Tensorflow version<=1.5
Keras
opencv-python
numpy,pandas


TO RUN THE CODE:
1. Kindly subsitute the path for test images and test.csv in the hackerearth_dl_beg_challenge.pynb file(preferably in the current directory).
2. Keep all other files/folders as such. I have saved my model parameters in the current directory.
3. Run hackerearth_dl_beg_challenge.pynb file.
4. Results will be saved in final.csv file.
5. For any issues, kindly contact on 9870142432/shu09bei@gmail.com.

TECHNIQUE USED:
I have used densenet pre-trained model to train my model the for the given task.

FEATURE ENGINEERING:
1. Each image is reduced to 224x224 pixels and further zero mean, unit variance normalization is done before feeding to our model input.
